# Austin-Crash-Severity-Prediction
This project focuses on predicting crash severity using Austin Crash Report data from the past two years. The notebook includes:

Data Preparation: Cleaning, encoding categorical variables, and addressing class imbalance using SMOTE.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing trends and identifying key features affecting crash severity.
Modeling: Implementing Logistic Regression, Random Forest, k-Nearest Neighbors, and Gradient Boosting.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizing model performance using Grid Search.
Evaluation: Comparing models based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
This repository provides a framework for analyzing crash data and generating predictive insights for safety and insurance applications.
